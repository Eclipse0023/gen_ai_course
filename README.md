This is a financial transcation categoriser that can categorise the transcations based on the notes/descriptions.
For this work, I am working on the following steps:
Reformat training data for processing, clean the note column of $
Create synthetic data of category.subcategory and then add to training data.
Test a gemini 2.0 flash on zero shot prompts, check the accuracy.
Fine tune a model and then check the accuracy.
